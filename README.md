# Crypbro Vitalik

This is a Facebook bot that can send updates on cryptocurrency prices.

## Development

To run locally, set the Facebook username and password env-vars, and then run:

```
npm install
node crypto_vitalik.js
```

## TODO

Some features that would be cool:
- Command to show top x currencies
- Ability to transfer currencies between addresses
